      <p class="paragraph paragraph--spaced">
        I am a student with little to no money to waste. With that said, my
        setup is always very intentionally picked. Without a further ado, this
        is my setup I use to develop.

        <p class="paragraph paragraph--spaced">
          My notebook of choice is Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 Onyx Black. The
          parameters I chose were extremely good for the price, when this
          configuration was available for purchase.
        </p>

        <ul class="list list--spaced centered">
          <li>
            Intel Core i5 10300H - quad core, 8 threads, 2.5 GHz base speed, up
            to 4.2 GHz turbo

        <p class="paragraph paragraph--spaced">
          The only downside to this notebook is the battery life. On Windows,
          you could technically get up to 5 hours of mileage, given that the
          tasks you are doing are super lightweight. However, I am using Ubuntu
          and I often connect to HDMI with the notebook. For that reason, I am
          always using the dedicated graphics card which is connected to the
          HDMI port directly. If I use the integrated graphics card, I
          experience screen tearing when the notebook lid is closed. This
          greatly affects the battery life though, so I usually get about two to
          three hours of work on battery.

        <p class="paragraph paragraph--spaced">
          I generally use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. Until recently I have been distro
          hopping a lot. When it came to Ubuntu, I just needed an operating
          system that would finally work well with NVIDIA drivers. After a bit
          of tweaking, I can say I am very pleased about the performance and
          overall feel of the system. One day, I will try either Arch based
          distro or Arch itself. And one day, I will probably even try to dig
          into Gentoo. Maybe one day...
