          However, I do not use it that much nowadays. I feel like it still has
          its place in embedded development, but it is not the best tool for
          everything. However, some solutions provide almost the same level of
          performance while being more modern. Some of those are

      <h2 class="heading">About me - Personal</h2>

        I was born in a small city in the centre of Slovakia, in the year 2000. Since I was a small child, computers have always fascinated me. In fourth grade, I wrote a school essay/project about computers, their history, and whatever I found interesting about them at that age. Later, since the sixth grade, I was very invested in building LEGO robots.

        With a group of friends, we have created a team. A team that later competed with other kids in Slovakia. We built robots that could do autonomous tasks on a game field. I initially wrote a lot of code for the robot. After a few competitions, my focus has shifted towards research projects and other competition areas, such as designing prospects and focusing on presentation skills.

        I have found a new passion in high school - I started to play the guitar! I f knew from the first day that I'd found a perfect hobby for me. That feeling has stuck with me until now. Nowadays, I play bass guitar in a thrash metal band called Technology of Death, where I also do vocals, write songs and lyrics and help with creative decisions of the band. I also occasionally play on my classical and electric guitars.

        My passion for programming has never left me, though. While I was still in high school, I pretty much knew that it was the career path for me to take. So I applied for the Faculty of Informatics (Computer Science) at Masaryk University.
